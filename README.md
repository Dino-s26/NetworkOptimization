# Network Optimization #
This Repository are made to share my Network Optimization, especially Automation using Python script.
####
Notes :
Before using any coding in this repo, 
you should already have understanding about Python coding (mostly using Python 3 for the coding) and Paramiko (API for SSH).
####

Requirement to run the Script :
1. Python 3.6.0
2. Paramiko API ( You can install it once you have Python, by using 'pip install paramiko' on cmd / powershell / terminal )
3. Basic Understading about Paramiko & Python coding, *you just need to understand how the coding work :)
4. [Optional] Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 for running the exe program once you compile it, if not then no need to use :)
